    title: "Security in Depth --- ‘When Security Theatre Just Isn’t Enough’ (A government perspective)"
    abstract: >
      We will examine a holistic approach to security leveraging on the approach taken by federal government agencies and contractors.

      Cursory examination of the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) and its principles applied in a manner to provide layered and durable security measures.  Whilst it will reference government material, this material is available publicly and can be utilized by anyone. This will be an overview of the approach with some demonstrative examples.  We will aim to demonstrate that security is more than just locks and firewalls and that managing the weakest link (people) is also key to securing information and assets.
