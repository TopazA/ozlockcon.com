    title: Practical RFID security training [BYO gear required]
    abstract: >
      This workshop will include both lecture style teaching about RFID access cards, covering protocols, formats and security measures as well as practical hands on training with the 'Proxmark3' open source RFID security tool. These exercises  will include how to identify an unknown RFID card, how to read the data from the card and how to clone it to a new blank card. It will cover both Low Frequency and High Frequency cards. Training will cover RFID card security measures and the options and attacks for cracking the cryptographic keys. Examples of insecure systems and suggestions for implementing secure access control systems will also be covered.

    title: Tricking people using magic tricks and pickpocketing
    abstract: >
      You know magicians? Pickpockets? How do they do it? How do they trick people so consistently? This talk is about using the same techniques a magician or pickpocket would use, but for social engineering and physical security mischief. We’ll exploit the wonky default settings of human brains for the sake of sneaking what you're doing past people. To a magician, your brain is probably running the wetware equivalent of Windows 95, so come along and get patched.

    title: "Security in Depth --- ‘When Security Theatre Just Isn’t Enough’ (A government perspective)"
    abstract: >
      We will examine a holistic approach to security leveraging on the approach taken by federal government agencies and contractors.

      Cursory examination of the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) and its principles applied in a manner to provide layered and durable security measures.  Whilst it will reference government material, this material is available publicly and can be utilized by anyone. This will be an overview of the approach with some demonstrative examples.  We will aim to demonstrate that security is more than just locks and firewalls and that managing the weakest link (people) is also key to securing information and assets.

    title: Dispelling the myth of key control
    abstract: >
      Using home made CNC and 3D printers one can recreate any mechanical key. The hard work has been done by the open source movement and now anyone with limited skill can get a computer to produce any key they need... and if the computer is producing keys for you, why not produce 32 variations?

      In this talk I will discuss the tools required and practical challenges involved in using a small CNC mill/3d printer to produce keys, and go on to extend that idea to automating privilege escalation attacks in master key systems.

    title: Red Teaming --- ‘You Must Go Beyond the Limits’
    abstract: >
      Red Teams are designed to penetrate security in a real world test of effectiveness of security controls, policy, technology and infrastructure. Red Teams view security from an adversary perspective in order to simulate realistic attack scenarios that enable an organisation as a whole to prepare and protect against both simple and sophisticated threats. Red Teams build security culture and provide opportunities for staff to be trained using real world examples.
