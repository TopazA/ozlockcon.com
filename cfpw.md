## Call for Papers

OzLockCon aims to be the first conference in Australia catering specifically to
physical security research and offensive and defensive techniques.

We aim to bring the openness and desire to share information found in the
information security industry to a different crowd. We are looking for
presenters to talk on a wide range of topics in an informal environment amongst
their peers.

### Talk topics

We are interested in the following topics:

* picking techniques
* bypass techniques
* impressioning techniques
* digital lock manipulation
* decoding locks
* safe manipulation
* locksport community and our hobby
* historical/antique locks
* privilege escalation attacks against lock systems
* key duplication
* alarm system attacks
* DIY tools and their making
* making cut-aways
* lock manufacturing
* metallurgy, metalworking, and material science research
* improving physical security
* 'tamper-evident' seals
* making challenge locks
* legal aspects of locksport in AU/NZ
* physical security within red teaming/penetration testing
* radio security (this can include mobile, pagers, CB radio)
* RFID/Magstripe/Smartcard security
* social engineering

Digital/Analogue attacks if relevant in the wider context of physical security
will be considered.

If you think your topic might still be of interest but isn't explicitly listed
here, please submit anyway and we will be happy to review regardless.

Make sure to submit early! The CFP will close April 30th 2017.

## Call for Workshops

In addition to the traditional 'talks' that will occur (like at most other
conferences) OzLockCon aims to have a fairly large amount of hands-on and
interactive content. This content should be relevant to topics covered in the
CFP and should be used as a guideline as to what we are interested.

We are looking for people to run workshops which can run anywhere between an
hour to the full course of the conference. If you require financial assistance
in order to run such a workshop (for example, to purchase a large number of
key-blanks and files to teach impressioning techniques) please state so in the
CFP and we'll attempt to make arrangements.
