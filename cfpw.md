## Call for Papers

OzLockCon aims to be the first conference in Australia catering specifically to
physical security research and offensive | defensive techniques.

We aim to bring the openness and desire to share information found in the
*information security industry* to a different crowd.

### Submissions

Please **[fill out our CFP/W Google Form](%missing_url%)** if you wish to submit a proposal for
either a talk or workshop.

<small>The call will close <strong>April 30th 2017</strong>.</small>

### Talk topics

We are looking for presenters to talk on a wide range of topics in an informal
environment amongst their peers.

Besides the following topics, in [the hacker-spirit of things](/faq#who-are-you)
we’d love submissions that hold great **technical detail** and/or provide a
**critical view** at an aspect or technology within the domain of physical
security.

So, some topic ideas—

* picking techniques
* bypass techniques and tools
* impressioning techniques
* digital lock manipulation
* decoding locks
* safe manipulation
* the locksport community and our hobby
* historical/antique locks
* privilege escalation attacks against lock systems
* key duplication
* alarm system attacks
* building access control systems
* motor vehicle security
* DIY tools and their making
* making cut-aways
* lock manufacturing
* metallurgy, metalworking, and material science research
* improving physical security

## Call for Workshops

In addition to the traditional 'talks' that will occur (like at most other
conferences) OzLockCon aims to have a large amount of hands-on and interactive
content.

We are looking for people to run workshops which can run anywhere between an
hour to the full course of the conference.

<small>If you require financial assistance in order to run such a workshop (for
example, to purchase a large number of key-blanks and files to teach
impressioning techniques) please state so in the CFP and we'll attempt to make
arrangements.</small>
