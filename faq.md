## Who are you?

We are a loose knit group of physical security enthusiasts. We come from a wide
variety of backgrounds, some of us are security professionals such as locksmiths
and IT security professionals. Others are simply hobbyists. What binds us all is
our common interest in locks.

In early 2016 we started a 'LockSport' slack channel as a place for like-minded
people to disucss and share knowledge around physical security. For the most
part, we grew from 'hacker-conferences' and as such, we've embraced the hacker
spirit of sharing information, teaching each other and learning together.

We aim to be like the conferences that occur in Europe and the US and hope one
day that the Australian locksport and physical security community can be
regarded as highly as our friends overseas.

We hope that the knowledge we share will be used for the betterment of all of us
and that the result of the conference will be a greater awareness of the
challenges faced when dealing with physical security. We also hope that those
that attend enjoy and compete in the competitions we have planned.

## Is this legal?

Yes.

## Is possession of lockpicking tools legal?

It depends on which State/Territory you live in -- possession within your own
home is legal in most of Australia.

## Aren't you teaching wannabe criminals?

We're going to borrow a quote as an answer:

> Rogues knew a good deal about lock-picking long before locksmiths discussed it
[...] If a lock is not so inviolable as it has hitherto been deemed to be,
surely it is to the interest of honest persons to know this fact, because the
dishonest are... certain to apply the knowledge practicallyâ€¦ the spread of the
knowledge is necessary to give fair play to those who might suffer by ignorance.
