## What is OzLockCon?

OzLockCon aims to be the first open and inclusive community event focusing on physical security controls in Australia.

The conference aims to introduce people from all areas of security, weather professionals or hobbyists, to new techniques, tools and ideas in order to discover more and either learn new skills or develop them further. Special attention given to locksport and lockpicking techniques and competitions will occur throughout the event.

We hope to have both standard talks and a variety of on-going workshops open to attendees with industry leading presenters and tutors.

## Conference date

The conference is scheduled to run in early 2017, likely around April/May and will be held in either Sydney or Melbourne.

More details to come soon so stay tuned!
